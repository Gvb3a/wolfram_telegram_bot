This telegram bot allows you to use [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) absolutely free with step-by-step solution and photo recognition. 
There is also a translator, so you can write in any language you want.
Try something like `x^2-5x+6=0`

This telegram bot works with [Wolfram|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/).
Wolfram|Alpha provides answers not by searching the Internet, but by performing dynamic computations based on a huge collection of built-in data, algorithms and methods.

The recognition is done by [SimpleTex](https://www.simpletex.net/). For successful recognition, you need to crop the photo so that ONLY what you want to calculate is visible. Nothing else!

Thanks to the translator you can write in any language you like.

I highly recommend that you watch the examples to better understand WolframAlpha's abilities:
